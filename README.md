Testing my new repository
Okay so let's see what this is about
It's always good to bring a **slower** friend with you on a hike. If you *happen* to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.
## Wild animals
1. Bears
2. Tigers
3. Hyenas

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

```python
print("Nothing")
```
